# Caesar Cipher

This program asks the user for a message to encrypt or decrypt with the Caesar Cipher, shifting letters by 3.

### Feature 1
Text from the user is encrypted and printed out. This feature is triggered by inputting a "1" after entering your text.

### Feature 2
Text from the user is decrypted and printed out. This feature is triggered by inputting a "2" after entering your text.

If the user inputs anything besides "1" or "2", an error message is shown and the program ends.
